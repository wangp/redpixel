<P> August 1999:
<P>I originally thought of the idea for this game about half a year
before I developed it (Jan 1999).  At the time I was trying to write a
top-down shooter called `Raid II' (dropped about 5 times!) so I
delayed it, while my brother worked on the tiny little sprites.
<P>The development (starting June that year) took three months.
The basic engine was working in a week, the rest of the time was
used getting the serial connection to go, and to tweak things a
little.  It has been a year since.
<P>Yesterday I fixed some really annoying bugs (see log.txt), and
tweaked the stats to increase the frag counts.  Now I am writing
this SGML manual to learn SGML.  It has been a successful project.
<P>But the code sucks. :-)
<P>
<P> June 2000
<P>The code has been cleaned up a lot, so is better now.  It's
still not worth a 1.0 though.  :-)
<P>
<P> December 2001
<P>I've had a change of heart and labelled it 1.0, just to "finish"
it.
