<P> Red Pixel is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License
which can be viewed in the file `COPYING' distributed with source code
package or from http://www.gnu.org/.
<P>Brennan Underwood's `fastsqrt' routines (in the src/fastsqrt
directory) do not fall under the LGPL.  (I don't know what licence it
falls under, but it's free software of some sort.)
<P>The slightly modified random number generator `rg_rand.c' was taken
from the Snippets collection, and remains in the public domain.
<P>`getopt.c' was taken from some mailing archive somewhere.  It
retains its license and copyright.
