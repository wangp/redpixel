<H2><A NAME="s4">4. The Code</A></H2>

<P>The code is being released under the GNU LGPL, for no particular
reason.  Brennan Underwood's `fastsqrt' routines (in the src/fastsqrt
directory) do <EM>not</EM> fall under the LGPL.  (I don't know what
licence it falls under, but it's free software of some sort.)
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 History </A>
</H2>

<P>I originally thought of the idea for this game about half a year before I developed
it (Jan 1999).  At the time I was trying to write a top-down shooter
called `Raid II' (dropped about 5 times!) so I delayed it, while my
brother worked on the tiny little sprites.
<P>The development (starting June that year) took three months.  The
basic engine was working in a week, the rest of the time was used getting
the serial connection to go, and to tweak things a little.  It has been
a year since.
<P>Yesterday I fixed some really annoying bugs (see log.txt), and tweaked
the stats to increase the frag counts.  Now I am writing this SGML
manual to learn SGML.  It has been a successful project.  
<P>But the code sucks.
<P>Every time I look back at a previous project, I think the code sucks.
That is a fact of life.  But it <EM>really</EM> sucks.  It's tempting to
go back a fix it all, using my new indenting and commenting format
(that is why the source code is inconsistent in some places), but that
would really be a waste of time.  So I am leaving the code as it is
now, as a finished project, and I just hope no-one takes it seriously.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2 Known ``Bugs''</A>
</H2>

<P>... that I will never fix.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>the blood particles drip through the walls.  This is too cool to
fix!</LI>
<LI>the guy sometimes gets stuck <EM>inside</EM> a wall.  This is a
problem with the structure of the code, so I am not going to walk
around the problem with a bunch of if's.  (Although I've already done
it a heap of times)</LI>
<LI>code is crap.  Live with it.</LI>
<LI>pickups are hard-coded into engine.  See above.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.3">4.3 To do</A>
</H2>

<P>Here are some things that I have not bothered to finish that would
make the code <EM>so</EM> much better.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>clean up code (eg. make globals <CODE>static</CODE>, etc.)</LI>
<LI>modularise the code</LI>
<LI>use linked-lists rather than arrays </LI>
<LI>config file (COM port settings, LCD cursor, etc.)</LI>
<LI><B>Port!</B></LI>
<LI>LAN support (most requested feature, I think)</LI>
</UL>
<P>I am never going to do the networking, because IMO the structure of the code
just cannot handle it.  Anyway, Red Pixel II will support it.  :)
