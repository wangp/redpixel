<P>August 1999:
<P>I originally thought of the idea for this game about half a year before I
developed it (Jan 1999).  At the time I was trying to write a top-down
shooter called `Raid II' (dropped about 5 times!) so I delayed it, while
my brother worked on the tiny little sprites.
<P>The development (starting June that year) took three months.  The
basic engine was working in a week, the rest of the time was used getting
the serial connection to go, and to tweak things a little.  It has been
a year since.
<P>Yesterday I fixed some really annoying bugs (see log.txt), and tweaked
the stats to increase the frag counts.  Now I am writing this SGML
manual to learn SGML.  It has been a successful project.
<P>But the code sucks. :-)
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 Known ``Bugs''</A>
</H2>

<P>... that I will never fix.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>the blood particles drip through the walls.  This is too cool to fix!</LI>
<LI>the guy sometimes gets stuck <EM>inside</EM> a wall.  This is a
problem with the way the engine was designed.  I am not going to walk
around the problem with a bunch of if's.</LI>
<LI>a ladder directly below a tile will allow the guy to pop up into the
tile</LI>
<LI>pickups are hard-coded into engine</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2 To do</A>
</H2>

<P>Here are some things that I have not bothered to finish.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>clean up and modularise the code </LI>
<LI>proper networking (client-server, packet loss detection, etc.)</LI>
<LI>use a scripting language</LI>
<LI>use linked-lists rather than arrays, where appropriate</LI>
<LI>config file (COM port settings, LCD cursor, etc.)</LI>
<LI>LAN support (most requested feature, I think)</LI>
</UL>
<P>I am never going to do the networking, because IMO the structure of the
code just cannot handle it.  Anyway, Red Pixel II will support it.  :-)
