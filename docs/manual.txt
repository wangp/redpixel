  1.4.

  Compiling from source



  This is only for the people wanting to compile the source for
  themselves.  If you downloaded an installer or precompiled binary, you
  can skip this part.

  Firstly, the three platforms supported are djgpp under DOS, gcc under
  Linux, and mingw32 under Windows.  You will also need to install the
  Allegro game programming library, version 4.0.  Then, simply type
  `make' in the game's root directory.

  Under Linux console you will need to run the binary with root
  permissions.  See `readme.lnx' in the Allegro distribution for more
  information.


  1.4.1.

  2.  The Game

  2.1.

  Concept



  The concept is a platform deathmatch game.  You run around a tile-
  based map, picking up various items and shooting your opponent.  None
  too original concept, but still the best :-)



  2.2.

  Story


  You have been thrown in a dungeon with another prisoner.  Contained
  within the dungeon are various magical objects, mostly weapons, which
  respawn after a certain time period.

  Surrounded by such weapons of destruction, you cannot resist the
  temptation to kill everyone around you.



  2.3.

  Starting the game


  Simply run the executable to start.  If you used the Windows
  installer, you can click on the item in the Start menu.

  Optionally, you can pass the following command line arguments.  Note
  that they are case sensitive.



     -e Start the ``map editor''.


     -q Skip introduction.


     -v Display version number.




  2.4.

  The main menu



  The main menu should be self explanatory, except for the little
  writing in the lower right corner of the screen.  See the ``stats
  section'' if you are curious about that.



  2.5.

  Connecting via a serial cable


  [Note: serial connection is currently not implemented in the Windows
  version.]

  Link two computers via a serial cable and start the game.  Select
  Start --> Serial, and then the correct COM port.  Enter your name,
  then wait for the computers to connect.

  If an error occurs, check to make sure you used the right command line
  option.  If you're are running a DOS executable under Windows, try
  running under pure DOS.  (If you have a Logitech mouse you could also
  also try what I did, and get updated mouse drivers (MouseWare) for it
  from their web site.)

  From here on, you will be shown a map selection screen.  Only the maps
  existing on both computers will be displayed.  Please make sure the
  maps are identical, otherwise your games will be unsynchronised. Press
  the up and down arrow keys to select a map. When you are ready to
  play, press `F10'.

  If your game become unsynchronised, quit the level and restart.  If it
  ever says ``SYNC PROBLEM'', then you'd better restart from the serial
  connection procedure.



  2.6.

  Connecting via Berkeley sockets or Winsock



  One machine must first select `Listen' then wait.  The other machine
  then selects `Connect'.  The connecting machine will need to enter the
  name or the IP address of the listening machine.

  After connection, the game acts as it would with a serial connection.

  Note: as this driver simply emulates a perfect serial link via a
  network, you can still only play two player games.  Also, you need a
  fast connection (e.g. LAN) between the machines, since the game runs
  synchronously.



  2.7.

  Controls



  o  Use the following keys to move around.  They are all equivalent.




            W                 T                  Up
        A - S - D       F - G - H         Left - Down - Right







  o  Aim the gun with the mouse, fire with the left mouse button.


  o  Select the weapon with the number keys, and with Q, E, R, Y.  The
     weapons you have collected will be displayed on the left.


  o  Press Enter or press the right mouse button to lay a mine.


  o  If you have one and you are running under Linux or Windows, you can
     switch weapons using a mouse wheel on an Intellimouse compatible
     mouse.  Please read `readme.lnx' in the Allegro distribution to see
     how to set this up under Linux.  Your mileage may vary, so don't be
     disappointed if it doesn't work.

  o  TAB to see your scores.

  o  ESC to quit.

  o  F12 to see the frame rate counter.



  2.8.

  Items



  o  Weapons

  o  Knife

  o  Pistol

  o  Shotgun

  o  Uzi

  o  M16 (just a big gun, nothing like an M16)

  o  Minigun

  o  Bow with explosive arrows

  o  Bazooka

  o  Mines



  o  Other items:

  o  Chicken (+health)


  o  Coke (+health)

  o  Armour.  Takes half the damage from an attack (1 health = 2 armour)

  o  Goggles.  Lights up your vision, for about a minute.

  o  Backpack.  You drop half of all your ammo when you die, but your
     guns disappear.

  o  Bloodlust.  Double damage for all weapons, except mines.  Be
     careful!

  o  Scanner.  Points in the direction of your enemy.



  2.9.

  Options


  There are a few things you can do in the options screen.

  Under ``DESIRED RESOLUTION'', you can pick a screen mode you want to
  use.  Be aware that not all of them may work on your system.  Higher
  resolutions are only recommended when the lower resolutions do not
  work.  You will NOT receive higher quality graphics, but rather a
  320x200 image will be stretched up.  The video mode is changed when
  you push ``ACCEPT''.

  If the ``SCANLINES'' option is enabled and you are in a high
  resolution video mode (either 640x400 or 640x480), then the game will
  try to create a ``scanline'' effect for you, where every second line
  is black.  This does not always work (in particular windowed modes
  often do not work).

  If the ``FILTERED'' option is enabled, you will get slightly blurred
  image, which you may or may not like (nice for demos, in my opinion).
  This requires a fast machine.

  There are three options for music playback.  You can have ``NO
  MUSIC'', which is the classic way to play Red Pixel.  You can also put
  some .MOD, .S3M and .XM files into the `music' directory, and select
  ``PLAY MODULES''.  The game will select songs to play at random.  Or,
  you can put a music CD into your CD drive and select ``PLAY CD''.

  The ``RECORD DEMOS'' option is explained in the ``demo section''.

  In the bottom left corner there is a button (usually labelled
  ``stats'' or similar).  This is explained in the ``next section''.



  2.10.

  Stats



  ``Stats'' are various little numbers that change how the game works,
  e.g. how much damage each gun can bring about and how fast it reloads,
  how much health you can have, etc.

  You can select different stats from the Options menu, using the button
  in the bottom left corner.  Once you select a stats file, the name of
  the stats file will be displayed in the lower right corner of the main
  menu.  To play with a network or serial game with another player, you
  must both select the same stats file (or you will receive an error
  message).

  Included with the game are three files `stats', `stats.07' and
  `stats.09'.  `stats' is the more up to date version, providing more
  powerful weapons with quicker reload and respawn rates.  `stats.07'
  and `stats.09' provide values from older versions, kept only for
  historic reasons.  You can create your own stats by copying one of
  them, and editing it with a text editor.



  2.11.

  Demos



  You can record your deathmatches into demo files.  To do this, switch
  on the ``Record demos'' option in the Options screen.

  When you start a new game, it will automatically save a demo into the
  current directory, named `demoXXXX.rec'.  Under Linux it will also try
  your home directory.

  To play a demo, simply choose the ``Play Demo'' menu item under
  ``Start'', then select a demo recording file.

  Special keys available only in demo playback mode:


  o  Enter - switch which player camera focuses on

  o  S - hold this down for slow motion mode

  o  F - hold this down for fast forward mode

  o  P - take screen shot

  Please note that if you exit a demo before its completion, it will
  display the frag count as of the time you quit.  (Sorry about that.)

  If you record a cool demo, whether a demostration of a cool move in
  solo mode, or a nice, bloody deathmatch, please send it to me!

  If a demo does not play back properly, sent it to me for debugging.  I
  won't be able to save the demo, but it may help me track down bugs to
  prevent this sort of thing in the future.  If you really hate losing
  demos, try recording on both machines.  Chances are, one of the
  recordings will be correct.



  2.12.

  Tips




  o  Use the 3D sound to find where your opponent is.  Also, eating food
     does not make a noise, but picking up things does.

  o  After you pick up an item, place a mine there.  Works also for
     regenerating walls (will not flash).
  o  The scanner is good for running away, as well as tracking down.


  o  If are being mowed down with a minigun, run and drop mines!  The
     blood will conceal it :)


  o  Jump over your enemy and lay mines.


  o  Jump up ladders, never climb.





  3.  The Map Editor

  3.1.

  Map editor keys


  After starting the map editor with `red -e' you will be presented with
  a blank screen.  On the bottom there is a palette and on the top there
  is a description of the current map, showing the top-left map
  coordinates and size.


  o  arrow keys to pan around

  o  1, 2, 3 to change editing modes (tiles, items, starting locations)

  o  I, J, K, L to change map size

  o  Ctrl-N to clear

  o  Ctrl-S to save

  o  Ctrl-L to load

  o  Ctrl-Q to quit (warning: does not prompt!)

  Select an item or tile with the left mouse button, place it on the map
  with the left mouse button.  Right mouse button clears.

  There is a set maximum of 24 starting locations on a single map.
  These appear as white flags (edit mode 3).



  3.2.

  Custom maps


  If you wish to play your custom maps, make sure that you have exactly
  the same file on both machines!  And make sure you send them to me so
  I can put them up on my web page.

  For compatibility reasons, filenames MUST be all lowercase on case-
  sensitive operating systems (i.e. Linux), and everyone should stick to
  the DOS 8.3 filename limits.

  Game history

  August 1999:

  I originally thought of the idea for this game about half a year
  before I developed it (Jan 1999).  At the time I was trying to write a
  top-down shooter called `Raid II' (dropped about 5 times!) so I
  delayed it, while my brother worked on the tiny little sprites.

  The development (starting June that year) took three months.  The
  basic engine was working in a week, the rest of the time was used
  getting the serial connection to go, and to tweak things a little.  It
  has been a year since.

  Yesterday I fixed some really annoying bugs (see log.txt), and tweaked
  the stats to increase the frag counts.  Now I am writing this SGML
  manual to learn SGML.  It has been a successful project.

  But the code sucks. :-)


  June 2000

  The code has been cleaned up a lot, so is better now.  It's still not
  worth a 1.0 though.  :-)


  December 2001

  I've had a change of heart and labelled it 1.0, just to "finish" it.



  4.1.

  Known Bugs



  o  the blood particles drip through the walls.  This is too cool to
     fix!

  o  the guy sometimes gets stuck inside a wall (often after explosion)

  o  a ladder directly below a tile will allow the guy to pop up into
     the tile

  o  you can jump through tiles placed diagonally
