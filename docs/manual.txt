  +o  serial cable

  +o  VGA-compliant card and monitor

  +o  8MB RAM

  +o  mouse

  +o  tolerance for gore

  +o  headphones recommended

  New in 0.10:


  +o  Linux port and maps by Peter Sundling (kaffepeter@telia.com)

  +o  stats.fst file


  New in 0.9:


  +o  a _l_o_t more blood and sparks, and better particle generation

  +o  added ````ssccaannnneerr'''' powerup

  +o  added new death sequence (fountain)

  +o  added cool backdrop for frag count

  +o  added ````----llccdd'''' option

  +o  right mouse button now drops mine

  +o  Q/E and R/Y now select next/prev weapons

  The biggest change version 0.9 (gameplay-wise) is the new stats for
  items.  This was designed to make frags easier, and to make the game
  more fun.  If you don't like the new style, note that you can get
  (almost) the same stats as in older versions with red -s stats.07.
  See section ``Stats'' for more information.

  If you are playing under DOS using the binary distribution, you can
  skip this section.

  You will need to firstly install Allegro (WIP 3.9.x or above), and
  either djgpp or gcc.  Then you should be able to simply type ``make''
  in the game's root directory.

  Under Linux console you will need to run the binary with root
  permissions.  See `readme.lnx' in the Allegro distribution for more
  information.



  22..  TThhee GGaammee

  22..11..  CCoonncceepptt

  The concept is a platform deathmatch game.  You run around a tile-
  based map, picking up various items and shooting your opponent.
  Original.


  22..22..  SSttoorryy

  (ahem)

  You have been thrown in a dungeon with a handful of other prisoners.
  Contained within the dungeon are various magical objects, mostly
  weapons, which respawn after a certain time period.

  Surrounded by such weapons of destruction, you cannot resist the
  temptation...


  22..33..  SSttaarrttiinngg tthhee ggaammee

  Simply run the executable rreedd..eexxee (or rreedd under Linux) to start.
  Please note the following command-line options are _c_a_s_e_-_s_e_n_s_i_t_i_v_e:



     ----eeddiitt,, --ee
        Start semi-built-in ``map editor''.

     ----llccdd,, --ll
        Use bright (ugly) version of mouse cursor.  Designed to be used
        on hard to see laptop displays.

     ----ssttaattss,, --ss
        Use alternative ``stats'' for items.

     ----ccoomm11,, --11
        Use COM1 for serial connections.

     ----ccoomm[[223344]],, --22,, --33,, --44
        Ditto.  Default is 2.

     ----sskkiipp,, --ss
        Skip introduction.

     ----vveerrssiioonn,, --vv
        Display version number.

  Note that you ccaannnnoott collate the options.  i.e. red -1ql is invalid.

  Linux users: COM1 = /dev/ttyS0; COM2 = /dev/ttyS1; etc.



  22..44..  SSeerriiaall ccoonnnneeccttiioonn ddeettaaiillss

  Link two computers via a serial cable in COM 1-4 (see Command line
  options in section ``Starting the game'').  Select `Start' -->
  `Serial'.  Enter your name, then wait for the computers to connect.
  If it hangs, press `Ctrl-Alt-End' and try again.

  If it says `Error opening COM port', check to make sure you used the
  right --comX option.  If you're are running Windows 9x, try running
  under pure DOS.  If you have a Logitech mouse you could also also try
  what I did, and get updated mouse drivers (MouseWare) for it from
  their web site.

  From here on, you will be shown a map selection screen.  Only the maps
  existing on both computers will be displayed.  Please make sure the
  maps are identical, otherwise your games will be unsynchronised. Press
  the up and down arrow keys to select a map.  You may also have a
  conversation of here if you wish.  Feel free to use any obscene words
  you desire.

  (Note: The chat box was designed in case the game ever supported
  Internet play.  However it may be also useful in other areas, e.g.
  library)

  When you are ready to play, press FF1100.

  If your game become unsynchronised, quit the level and restart.  If it
  ever says _S_Y_N_C _P_R_O_B_L_E_M, then you'd better restart from the serial
  connection procedure.


  22..55..  CCoonnttrroollss


  +o  Use the following keys to move around.  They are all equivalent.


               W               T                       Up
           A - S - D       F - G - H           Left - Down - Right




  +o  Aim the gun with the mouse, fire with the _l_e_f_t _m_o_u_s_e _b_u_t_t_o_n.

  +o  Select the weapon with the _n_u_m_b_e_r _k_e_y_s, and with _Q_, _E_, _R_, _Y.  The
     weapons you have collected will be displayed on the left.  Press
     _E_n_t_e_r or press the _r_i_g_h_t _m_o_u_s_e _b_u_t_t_o_n to lay a mine.

  +o  _T_A_B to see your scores.  _E_S_C to quit.

  +o  _F_1_2 to see the frame rate counter.  This is a development feature,
     so it's not supposed to work properly.  Just push it quickly and
     see.


  22..66..  IItteemmss


  +o  Weapons

  +o  Knife

  +o  Pistol


  +o  Shotgun

  +o  Uzi

  +o  M16 (just a big gun, nothing like an M16)

  +o  Minigun

  +o  Bow with explosive arrows

  +o  Bazooka

  +o  Mines

  +o  Other items:

  +o  Chicken (+health)

  +o  Coke (+health)

  +o  Armour.  Takes half the damage from an attack (1 health = 2 armour)

  +o  Goggles.  Lights up your vision, for about a minute.

  +o  Backpack.  You drop half of all your ammo when you die, but your
     guns disappear.

  +o  Bloodlust.  Double damage for all weapons, except mines.  Be
     careful!  Lasts 30 seconds.

  +o  Scanner.  Points in the direction of your enemy.


  22..77..  SSttaattss

  Included with the game are three files stats, stats.07 stats.fst.
  stats is the more up to date version, providing more powerful weapons
  with quicker reload and respawn rates.  stats.07 contains the older
  values, kept only for historic reasons.  stats.fst contains values
  that will quickly increase the body count.

  You can create your own stats by copying one of them, and editing them
  with a text editor, then use it with


       ______________________________________________________________________
       > red --stats mystats
       ______________________________________________________________________




  Note that both machines will need eexxaaccttllyy the same file, and both must
  run with the -s command-line option.  You have been warned.


  22..88..  TTiippss


  +o  Use the 3D sound to find where your opponent is.  Also, eating food
     does not make a noise, but picking up things does.

  +o  After you pick up an item, place a mine there.  Works also for
     regenerating walls (will not flash).


  +o  The scanner is good for pursuit, as well as flight.

  +o  If are being mowed down with a minigun, run and drop mines!  The
     blood will conceal it :)

  +o  Jump over your enemy and lay mines.

  +o  Jump up ladders, never climb.




  33..  TThhee MMaapp EEddiittoorr

  33..11..  MMaapp eeddiittoorr kkeeyyss

  After starting the map editor with red --edit you will be presented
  with a blank screen.  On the bottom there is a ppaalleettttee and on the top
  there is a description of the current map, showing the top-left map
  coordinates and size.


  +o  arrow keys to pan around

  +o  1, 2, 3 to change editing modes (tiles, items, starting locations)

  +o  I, J, K, L to change map size

  +o  Ctrl-N to clear

  +o  Ctrl-S to save

  +o  Ctrl-L to load

  +o  Ctrl-Q to quit (_w_a_r_n_i_n_g: does not prompt!)

  Select an item or tile with the left mouse button, place it on the map
  with the LMB.  Right mouse button clears.

  There is a set maximum of 24 starting locations on a single map.
  These appear as white flags (edit mode 3).


  33..22..  CCuussttoomm mmaappss

  If you wish to play your custom maps, make sure that you have exactly
  the same file on both machines!  And make sure you send them to me so
  I can put them up on my web page.



  44..  GGaammee hhiissttoorryy

  August 1999:

  I originally thought of the idea for this game about half a year
  before I developed it (Jan 1999).  At the time I was trying to write a
  top-down shooter called `Raid II' (dropped about 5 times!) so I
  delayed it, while my brother worked on the tiny little sprites.

  The development (starting June that year) took three months.  The
  basic engine was working in a week, the rest of the time was used
  getting the serial connection to go, and to tweak things a little.  It
  has been a year since.


  Yesterday I fixed some really annoying bugs (see log.txt), and tweaked
  the stats to increase the frag counts.  Now I am writing this SGML
  manual to learn SGML.  It has been a successful project.

  But the code sucks. :-)


  44..11..  KKnnoowwnn ````BBuuggss''''

  ... that I will never fix.


  +o  the blood particles drip through the walls.  This is too cool to
     fix!

  +o  the guy sometimes gets stuck _i_n_s_i_d_e a wall.  This is a problem with
     the way the engine was designed.  I am not going to walk around the
     problem with a bunch of if's.

  +o  a ladder directly below a tile will allow the guy to pop up into
     the tile

  +o  pickups are hard-coded into engine


  44..22..  TToo ddoo

  Here are some things that I have not bothered to finish.


  +o  clean up and modularise the code

  +o  proper networking (client-server, packet loss detection, etc.)

  +o  use a scripting language

  +o  use linked-lists rather than arrays, where appropriate

  +o  config file (COM port settings, LCD cursor, etc.)

  +o  LAN support (most requested feature, I think)

  I am never going to do the networking, because IMO the structure of
  the code just cannot handle it.  Anyway, Red Pixel II will support it.
  :-)
