<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 Concept</A>
</H2>

<P>The concept is platform deathmatch.  
You run around a tile-based map, picking up <EM>stuff</EM> and shoot your 
opponent.  Original.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 Story (ahem)</A>
</H2>

<P>You have been thrown in a dungeon with a handful of other
prisoners. Contained within the dungeon are various magical objects,
mostly weapons, which respawn after a certain time period.
<P>Surrounded by such weapons of destruction, you cannot resist the
temptation... <EM>yes!</EM>
<P><EM>Please</EM> don't take this too seriously...
<P>
<H2><A NAME="sec-starting"></A> <A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 Starting the game</A>
</H2>

<P>Simply run the executable <B>red.exe</B> to start.  Please note the
following <EM>case-sensitive</EM> command-line options:
<P>
<DL>
<P>
<A NAME="sec-cmdline"></A> <DT><B>--edit, -e</B><DD><P>Start semi-built-in 
<A HREF="manual-3.htm#sec-mapeditor">map editor</A>.
<DT><B>--lcd, -l</B><DD><P>Use bright (ugly) version of mouse cursor.  Designed 
to be used on hard to see laptop displays.
<DT><B>--stats, -s</B><DD><P>Use alternative 
<A HREF="#sec-stats">stats</A> for items.
<DT><B>--com1, -1</B><DD><P>Use COM1 for serial connections.
<DT><B>--com[234], -2, -3, -4</B><DD><P>Ditto.  Default is 2.
<DT><B>--skip, -s</B><DD><P>Skip introduction.
<DT><B>--version, -v</B><DD><P>Display version number.
</DL>
<P>Note that you <B>cannot</B> collate the options.  e.g. you can't do: <CODE>red
-1ql</CODE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.4">2.4 Serial connection details (and trouble-shooting)</A>
</H2>

<P>Link two computers via serial cable in COM 1-4 (see Command line
options in section 
<A HREF="#sec-starting">Starting the game</A>).  
Select `Start' --> `Serial'.  Enter your name, then wait for
the computers to connect.  If it hangs, press Ctrl-Alt-End and try
again.
<P>If it says `Error opening COM port', check to make
sure you used the right <CODE>--comX</CODE> option.  If you're are
running Windows 9x, try running under pure DOS.  If you have a
Logitech mouse you could also also try what I did, and get updated
mouse drivers (MouseWare) for it from their web site.
<P>From here on, you will be shown a map selection screen.  Only the maps
existing on BOTH computers will be displayed.  Please make sure the
maps are identical, otherwise your games will be unsynchronised.
Press Up/Down to selection a map.  You may also have a conversation of
here if you wish.  Please feel free to use any obscene words you
desire.
<P>(Note: The chat box was designed in case the game ever supported
Internet play.  However it may be also useful in other areas,
e.g. library :)
<P>When you are ready to die, press <B>F10</B>.
<P>If it ever says <EM>SYNC PROBLEM</EM>, then you'd better quit and restart.

<H2><A NAME="sec-stats"></A> <A NAME="ss2.7">2.7 Stats</A>
</H2>

<P>Included with the game are two files <CODE>stats</CODE> and <CODE>stats.07</CODE>.
<CODE>stats</CODE> is the more up to date version, providing more powerful
weapons with quicker reload and respawn rates.  <CODE>stats.07</CODE>
contains the older values, kept only for historic reasons.  
<P>You can create your own stats by copying one of them, and editing
them with a text editor, then use it with 
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
&gt; red --stats mystats
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
  
Note that both machine will need <B>exactly</B> the same file, and both
must run with the <CODE>-s</CODE> command-line option.  You have been warned.

<P>
<UL>
<LI>Use the 3D sound to find where your opponent is.  Also, eating food 
does not make a noise, but picking up things does.</LI>
<LI>After you pick up an item, place a mine there.  Works also for
regenerating walls (will not flash).</LI>
<LI>The scanner is good for pursuit, as well as flight.</LI>
<LI>If are being mowed down with a minigun, run and drop mines!  The
blood will conceal it :)</LI>
<LI>Jump over your enemy and lay mines.</LI>
<LI>Jump up ladders, never climb.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Send us some more!
