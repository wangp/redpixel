<H2><A NAME="s2">2. The Game</A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 Concept</A>
  </H2>

<P> 
<P>The concept is a platform deathmatch game.  You run around a
tile-based map, picking up various items and shooting your
opponent.  Original.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 Story</A>
  </H2>

<P>
<P>You have been thrown in a dungeon with a handful of other
prisoners. Contained within the dungeon are various magical
objects, mostly weapons, which respawn after a certain time
period.
<P>Surrounded by such weapons of destruction, you cannot resist the
temptation to kill everyone around you.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 Compiling</A>
  </H2>

<P> 
<P>If you are planning to use a precompiled executable, you can skip
this section.
<P>Firstly you need a working C compiler.  I use gcc under Linux
(obviously), djgpp under DOS, and mingw32 under Windows.
<P>Then you need to install the Allegro game programming library (WIP
3.9.32 or above).  If you want sockets support, you will also need to
install Libnet.  If you want CD playing support, you will also need to
install libcda.  (see below for URLs)
<P>From there you should be able to simply type `make' in the game's root
directory.  If you don't have Libnet, type `make WITHOUT_LIBNET=1'.
If you want CD playing supprt, add `WITH_LIBCDA=1' to the command
line.  If you are compiling with mingw32, add `MINGW32=1'.
<P>Under Linux console you will need to run the binary with root
permissions.  See `readme.lnx' in the Allegro distribution for
more information.

  </H2>

<P>
<P>Simply run the executable to start, optionally passing the
following command line arguments.  Please note that they are case
sensitive.

</DL>
<P>You can collate the options together, e.g. `red -qld'.
<P>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.5">2.5 Connecting via a serial cable</A>
  </H2>

<P>
<P>Link two computers via a serial cable and start the game.  Select
Start --> Serial, and then the correct COM port.  Enter your name, then wait
for the computers to connect.
<P>If an error occurs, check to make sure you used the right
command line option.  If you're are running a DOS executable
under Windows, try running under pure DOS.  (If you have a
Logitech mouse you could also also try what I did, and get
updated mouse drivers (MouseWare) for it from their web site.)
<P>From here on, you will be shown a map selection screen.  Only
the maps existing on both computers will be displayed.  Please
make sure the maps are identical, otherwise your games will be
unsynchronised. Press the up and down arrow keys to select a
map. When you are ready to play, press `F10'.
<P>If your game become unsynchronised, quit the level and restart.
If it ever says ``SYNC PROBLEM'', then you'd better restart from
the serial connection procedure.
<P>Note: serial connection is currently not implemented in the
native Windows port.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="sec-sockets"></A> <A NAME="ss2.6">2.6 Connecting via Berkeley sockets or Winsock </A>
  </H2>

<P> 
<P>Note: you must have compiled with Libnet support for this to work.
<P>One machine must select `Listen' while the one other selects
`Connect'.  It works better if the listening machine starts first.
The connecting machine will need to enter the IP address of the
listening machine (e.g. 192.168.1.1).  DNS names are not
supported.
<P>After connection, the game acts as it would with a serial connection.
<P>Note: as this driver simply emulates a perfect serial link via a
network, you can still only play two player games.  Also, you need a
fast connection between the machines, since the game still runs
synchronously.

<LI> If you have one and you are running under Linux or Windows, you can
switch weapons using a mouse wheel on an Intellimouse

Allegro distribution to see how to set this up under
Linux.  Your mileage may vary, so don't be disappointed
if it doesn't work.

<H2><A NAME="sec-stats"></A> <A NAME="ss2.9">2.9 Stats </A>
  </H2>

<P> 
<P>Included with the game are three files `stats', `stats.07' and
`stats.09'.  `stats' is the more up to date version, providing
more powerful weapons with quicker reload and respawn rates.
`stats.07' and `stats.09' provide values from older versions, kept
only for historic reasons.
<P>You can create your own stats by copying one of them, and editing
it with a text editor.
<P>Note that both machines will need exactly the same file, and both
must run with the `-s' command-line option.  You have been warned.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="sec-demo"></A> <A NAME="ss2.10">2.10 Demos </A>
  </H2>

<P> 
<P>You can record your deathmatches into demo files.  To do this,
first start Red Pixel using the `-d' command-line option.
<P>When you start a new game, it will automatically save a demo into
the current directory, named `demoXXXX.rec' or, if that is
unwritable, into your home directory (if you don't know what I'm
talking about, don't worry).
<P>To play a demo, simply choose the ``Play Demo'' menu item under
``Start''.
<P>Special keys available only in demo playback mode:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Enter - switch which player camera focuses on</LI>
<LI> S - hold this down for slow motion mode</LI>
<LI> F - hold this down for fast forward mode</LI>
<LI> P - take screen shot</LI>
</UL>
<P>Please note that if you exit a demo before its completion, it will
display the frag count as of the time you quit.
<P>If you record a cool demo, whether a demostration of a cool move
in solo mode, or a nice, bloody deathmatch, please send it to me!
<P>If a demo does not play back properly, sent it to me for
debugging.  I won't be able to save the demo, but it may help me
track down bugs to prevent this sort of thing in the future.  If
you really hate losing demos, try recording on both machines.

<P> 
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Use the 3D sound to find where your opponent is.  Also, eating
food does not make a noise, but picking up things does.
</LI>
<LI> After you pick up an item, place a mine there.  Works also for
regenerating walls (will not flash).
    </LI>
<LI> The scanner is good for running away, as well as tracking down.
    </LI>
<LI> If are being mowed down with a minigun, run and drop mines!  The
blood will conceal it :)
    </LI>
<LI> Jump over your enemy and lay mines.
    </LI>
<LI> Jump up ladders, never climb.</LI>
