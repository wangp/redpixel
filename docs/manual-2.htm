<H2><A NAME="s2">2. The Game</A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 Concept</A>
</H2>

<P>The concept is a platform deathmatch game.  You run around a tile-based map, 
picking up various items and shooting your opponent.  Original.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 Story</A>
</H2>

<P>(ahem)
<P>You have been thrown in a dungeon with a handful of other
prisoners. Contained within the dungeon are various magical objects,
mostly weapons, which respawn after a certain time period.
<P>Surrounded by such weapons of destruction, you cannot resist the
temptation...
<P>
<H2><A NAME="sec-starting"></A> <A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 Starting the game</A>
</H2>

<P>Simply run the executable <B>red.exe</B> (or <B>red</B> under Linux) to start.
Please note the following command-line options are <EM>case-sensitive</EM>:
<P>
<DL>
<P>
<A NAME="sec-cmdline"></A> <DT><B>--edit, -e</B><DD><P>Start semi-built-in 
<A HREF="manual-3.htm#sec-mapeditor">map editor</A>.
<DT><B>--lcd, -l</B><DD><P>Use bright (ugly) version of mouse cursor.  Designed 
to be used on hard to see laptop displays.
<DT><B>--stats, -s</B><DD><P>Use alternative 
<A HREF="#sec-stats">stats</A> for items.
<DT><B>--com1, -1</B><DD><P>Use COM1 for serial connections.
<DT><B>--com[234], -2, -3, -4</B><DD><P>Ditto.  Default is 2.
<DT><B>--skip, -s</B><DD><P>Skip introduction.
<DT><B>--version, -v</B><DD><P>Display version number.
</DL>
<P>Note that you <B>cannot</B> collate the options.  i.e. <CODE>red
-1ql</CODE> is invalid.
<P>Linux users: COM1 = /dev/ttyS0; COM2 = /dev/ttyS1; etc.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.4">2.4 Serial connection details </A>
</H2>

<P>Link two computers via a serial cable in COM 1-4 (see Command line
options in section 
<A HREF="#sec-starting">Starting the game</A>).  
Select `Start' --> `Serial'.  Enter your name, then wait for
the computers to connect.  If it hangs, press `Ctrl-Alt-End' and try
again.
<P>If it says `Error opening COM port', check to make
sure you used the right <CODE>--comX</CODE> option.  If you're are
running Windows 9x, try running under pure DOS.  If you have a
Logitech mouse you could also also try what I did, and get updated
mouse drivers (MouseWare) for it from their web site.
<P>From here on, you will be shown a map selection screen.  Only the maps
existing on both computers will be displayed.  Please make sure the maps
are identical, otherwise your games will be unsynchronised. Press the up
and down arrow keys to select a map.  You may also have a conversation of
here if you wish.  Feel free to use any obscene words you desire.
<P>(Note: The chat box was designed in case the game ever supported
Internet play.  However it may be also useful in other areas, 
e.g. library)
<P>When you are ready to play, press <B>F10</B>.
<P>If your game become unsynchronised, quit the level and restart.
If it ever says <EM>SYNC PROBLEM</EM>, then you'd better restart 
from the serial connection procedure.

<H2><A NAME="sec-stats"></A> <A NAME="ss2.7">2.7 Stats</A>
</H2>

<P>Included with the game are three files <CODE>stats</CODE>, <CODE>stats.07</CODE>
<CODE>stats.fst</CODE>.
<CODE>stats</CODE> is the more up to date version, providing more powerful
weapons with quicker reload and respawn rates.  <CODE>stats.07</CODE>
contains the older values, kept only for historic reasons.  <CODE>stats.fst</CODE>
contains values that will quickly increase the body count.
<P>You can create your own stats by copying one of them, and editing
them with a text editor, then use it with 
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
&gt; red --stats mystats
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
  
Note that both machines will need <B>exactly</B> the same file, and both
must run with the <CODE>-s</CODE> command-line option.  You have been warned.

<H2><A NAME="ss2.8">2.8 Tips</A>
</H2>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>Use the 3D sound to find where your opponent is.  Also, eating food 
does not make a noise, but picking up things does.</LI>
<LI>After you pick up an item, place a mine there.  Works also for
regenerating walls (will not flash).</LI>
<LI>The scanner is good for pursuit, as well as flight.</LI>
<LI>If are being mowed down with a minigun, run and drop mines!  The
blood will conceal it :)</LI>
<LI>Jump over your enemy and lay mines.</LI>
<LI>Jump up ladders, never climb.</LI>
