<H2><A NAME="s2">2. The Game</A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 Concept</A>
  </H2>

<P> 
<P>The concept is a platform deathmatch game.  You run around a
tile-based map, picking up various items and shooting your
opponent.  None too original concept, but still the best :-)
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 Story</A>
  </H2>

<P>
<P>You have been thrown in a dungeon with another prisoner.
Contained within the dungeon are various magical objects, mostly
weapons, which respawn after a certain time period.
<P>Surrounded by such weapons of destruction, you cannot resist the
temptation to kill everyone around you.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="sec-starting"></A> <A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 Starting the game </A>
  </H2>

<P>
<P>Simply run the executable to start.  If you used the Windows
installer, you can click on the item in the Start menu.
<P>Optionally, you can pass the following command line arguments.
Note that they are case sensitive.
<P>
<DL>
<P>
<A NAME="sec-cmdline"></A> <DT><B>-e</B><DD><P>Start the 
<A HREF="manual-3.html#sec-mapeditor">map editor</A>.
<P>
<DT><B>-q</B><DD><P>Skip introduction.
<P>
<DT><B>-v</B><DD><P>Display version number.
<P>
</DL>
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.4">2.4 The main menu</A>
  </H2>

<P>
<P>The main menu should be self explanatory, except for the little
writing in the lower right corner of the screen.  See the 
<A HREF="#sec-stats">stats section</A>
if you are curious about that.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.5">2.5 Connecting via a serial cable</A>
  </H2>

<P>
<P>[Note: serial connection is currently not implemented in the
Windows version.]
<P>Link two computers via a serial cable and start the game.  Select
Start --> Serial, and then the correct COM port.  Enter your name,
then wait for the computers to connect.
<P>If an error occurs, check to make sure you used the right
command line option.  If you're are running a DOS executable
under Windows, try running under pure DOS.  (If you have a
Logitech mouse you could also also try what I did, and get
updated mouse drivers (MouseWare) for it from their web site.)
<P>From here on, you will be shown a map selection screen.  Only
the maps existing on both computers will be displayed.  Please
make sure the maps are identical, otherwise your games will be
unsynchronised. Press the up and down arrow keys to select a
map. When you are ready to play, press `F10'.
<P>If your game become unsynchronised, quit the level and restart.
If it ever says ``SYNC PROBLEM'', then you'd better restart from
the serial connection procedure.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="sec-sockets"></A> <A NAME="ss2.6">2.6 Connecting via Berkeley sockets or Winsock </A>
  </H2>

<P> 
<P>One machine must first select `Listen' then wait.  The other
machine then selects `Connect'.  The connecting machine will need
to enter the name or the IP address of the listening machine.
<P>After connection, the game acts as it would with a serial connection.
<P>Note: as this driver simply emulates a perfect serial link via a
network, you can still only play two player games.  Also, you need
a fast connection (e.g. LAN) between the machines, since the game
runs synchronously.

the Allegro distribution to see how to set this up under
Linux.  Your mileage may vary, so don't be disappointed if
it doesn't work.

<H2><A NAME="sec-options"></A> <A NAME="ss2.9">2.9 Options </A>
  </H2>

<P>
<P>There are a few things you can do in the options screen.
<P>Under ``DESIRED RESOLUTION'', you can pick a screen mode you want
to use.  Be aware that not all of them may work on your system.
Higher resolutions are only recommended when the lower resolutions
do not work.  You will NOT receive higher quality graphics, but
rather a 320x200 image will be stretched up.  The video mode is
changed when you push ``ACCEPT''.
<P>If the ``SCANLINES'' option is enabled and you are in a high
resolution video mode (either 640x400 or 640x480), then the game
will try to create a ``scanline'' effect for you, where every
second line is black.  This does not always work (in particular
windowed modes often do not work).
<P>If the ``FILTERED'' option is enabled, you will get slightly
blurred image, which you may or may not like (nice for demos, in
my opinion).  This requires a fast machine.
<P>There are three options for music playback.  You can have ``NO
MUSIC'', which is the classic way to play Red Pixel.  You can also
put some .MOD, .S3M and .XM files into the `music' directory, and
select ``PLAY MODULES''.  The game will select songs to play at
random.  Or, you can put a music CD into your CD drive and select
``PLAY CD''.
<P>The ``RECORD DEMOS'' option is explained in the 
<A HREF="#sec-demo">demo section</A>.
<P>In the bottom left corner there is a button (usually labelled
``stats'' or similar).  This is explained in the 
<A HREF="#sec-stats">next section</A>.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="sec-stats"></A> <A NAME="ss2.10">2.10 Stats </A>
  </H2>

<P> 
<P>``Stats'' are various little numbers that change how the game
works, e.g. how much damage each gun can bring about and how fast
it reloads, how much health you can have, etc.
<P>You can select different stats from the Options menu, using the
button in the bottom left corner.  Once you select a stats file,
the name of the stats file will be displayed in the lower right
corner of the main menu.  To play with a network or serial game
with another player, you must both select the same stats file (or
you will receive an error message).
<P>Included with the game are three files `stats', `stats.07' and
`stats.09'.  `stats' is the more up to date version, providing
more powerful weapons with quicker reload and respawn rates.
`stats.07' and `stats.09' provide values from older versions, kept
only for historic reasons.  You can create your own stats by
copying one of them, and editing it with a text editor.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="sec-demo"></A> <A NAME="ss2.11">2.11 Demos </A>
  </H2>

<P> 
<P>You can record your deathmatches into demo files.  To do this,
switch on the ``Record demos'' option in the Options screen.
<P>When you start a new game, it will automatically save a demo into
the current directory, named `demoXXXX.rec'.  Under Linux it will
also try your home directory.
<P>To play a demo, simply choose the ``Play Demo'' menu item under
``Start'', then select a demo recording file.
<P>Special keys available only in demo playback mode:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Enter - switch which player camera focuses on</LI>
<LI> S - hold this down for slow motion mode</LI>
<LI> F - hold this down for fast forward mode</LI>
<LI> P - take screen shot</LI>
</UL>
<P>Please note that if you exit a demo before its completion, it will
display the frag count as of the time you quit.  (Sorry about
that.)
<P>If you record a cool demo, whether a demostration of a cool move
in solo mode, or a nice, bloody deathmatch, please send it to me!
<P>If a demo does not play back properly, sent it to me for
debugging.  I won't be able to save the demo, but it may help me
track down bugs to prevent this sort of thing in the future.  If
you really hate losing demos, try recording on both machines.
Chances are, one of the recordings will be correct.
<P>

<P> 
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Use the 3D sound to find where your opponent is.  Also, eating
food does not make a noise, but picking up things does.
</LI>
<LI> After you pick up an item, place a mine there.  Works also for
regenerating walls (will not flash).
    </LI>
<LI> The scanner is good for running away, as well as tracking down.
    </LI>
<LI> If are being mowed down with a minigun, run and drop mines!  The
blood will conceal it :)
    </LI>
<LI> Jump over your enemy and lay mines.
    </LI>
<LI> Jump up ladders, never climb.</LI>
