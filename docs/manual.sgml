<sect1> Compiling from source

  <p> 

    This is only for the people wanting to compile the source for
    themselves.  If you downloaded an installer or precompiled binary,
    you can skip this part.

    Firstly, the three platforms supported are djgpp under DOS, gcc
    under Linux, and mingw32 under Windows.  You will also need to
    install the Allegro game programming library, version 4.0.
    Then, simply type `make' in the game's root directory.

    Under Linux console you will need to run the binary with root
    permissions.  See `readme.lnx' in the Allegro distribution for
    more information.

<!-- Next Section: The Game -->

<sect> The Game


<sect1> Concept

  <p> 

    The concept is a platform deathmatch game.  You run around a
    tile-based map, picking up various items and shooting your
    opponent.  None too original concept, but still the best :-)


<sect1> Story

  <p>

    You have been thrown in a dungeon with another prisoner.
    Contained within the dungeon are various magical objects, mostly
    weapons, which respawn after a certain time period.

    Surrounded by such weapons of destruction, you cannot resist the
    temptation to kill everyone around you.


<sect1> Starting the game <label id="sec-starting">

  <p>

    Simply run the executable to start.  If you used the Windows
    installer, you can click on the item in the Start menu.

    Optionally, you can pass the following command line arguments.
    Note that they are case sensitive.

    <descrip> <label id="sec-cmdline">
      <tag/-e/ Start the <ref id="sec-mapeditor" name="map editor">.
    
      <tag/-q/ Skip introduction.
    
      <tag/-v/ Display version number.

    </descrip>


<sect1> The main menu

  <p>

    The main menu should be self explanatory, except for the little
    writing in the lower right corner of the screen.  See the <ref id="sec-stats" name="stats section">
    if you are curious about that.


<sect1> Connecting via a serial cable

  <p>

    [Note: serial connection is currently not implemented in the
    Windows version.]

    Link two computers via a serial cable and start the game.  Select
    Start --> Serial, and then the correct COM port.  Enter your name,
    then wait for the computers to connect.

    If an error occurs, check to make sure you used the right
    command line option.  If you're are running a DOS executable
    under Windows, try running under pure DOS.  (If you have a
    Logitech mouse you could also also try what I did, and get
    updated mouse drivers (MouseWare) for it from their web site.)

    From here on, you will be shown a map selection screen.  Only
    the maps existing on both computers will be displayed.  Please
    make sure the maps are identical, otherwise your games will be
    unsynchronised. Press the up and down arrow keys to select a
    map. When you are ready to play, press `F10'.

    If your game become unsynchronised, quit the level and restart.
    If it ever says ``SYNC PROBLEM'', then you'd better restart from
    the serial connection procedure.


<sect1> Connecting via Berkeley sockets or Winsock <label id="sec-sockets">

  <p> 

    One machine must first select `Listen' then wait.  The other
    machine then selects `Connect'.  The connecting machine will need
    to enter the name or the IP address of the listening machine.

    After connection, the game acts as it would with a serial connection.

    Note: as this driver simply emulates a perfect serial link via a
    network, you can still only play two player games.  Also, you need
    a fast connection (e.g. LAN) between the machines, since the game
    runs synchronously.


<sect1> Controls

  <p>

    <itemize>
    <item> Use the following keys to move around.  They are all equivalent.
    
      <tscreen> <verb>
          W	            T		       Up
      A - S - D       F - G - H		Left - Down - Right
      </verb> </tscreen>
    
    <item> Aim the gun with the mouse, fire with the left mouse button.
    
    <item> Select the weapon with the number keys, and with Q, E, R, Y.
     	   The weapons you have collected will be displayed on the left.
    
    <item> Press Enter or press the right mouse button to lay a mine.
    
    <item> If you have one and you are running under Linux or Windows,
    	   you can switch weapons using a mouse wheel on an
    	   Intellimouse compatible mouse.  Please read `readme.lnx' in
    	   the Allegro distribution to see how to set this up under
    	   Linux.  Your mileage may vary, so don't be disappointed if
    	   it doesn't work.

    <item> TAB to see your scores.
    <item> ESC to quit.
    <item> F12 to see the frame rate counter.

    </itemize>

        <item> Knife
        <item> Pistol
        <item> Shotgun
        <item> Uzi
        <item> M16 (just a big gun, nothing like an M16)
        <item> Minigun
        <item> Bow with explosive arrows
        <item> Bazooka
        <item> Mines
      </itemize>
       
      <item> Other items:
      <itemize>
        <item> Chicken (+health)
        <item> Coke (+health)
        <item> Armour.  Takes half the damage from an attack (1 health = 2 armour)
        <item> Goggles.  Lights up your vision, for about a minute.
        <item> Backpack.  You drop half of all your ammo when you die,
               but your guns disappear.
        <item> Bloodlust.  Double damage for all weapons, except mines.  Be careful!
        <item> Scanner.  Points in the direction of your enemy.
      </itemize>
    </itemize>


<sect1> Options <label id="sec-options">

  <p>

    There are a few things you can do in the options screen.

    Under ``DESIRED RESOLUTION'', you can pick a screen mode you want
    to use.  Be aware that not all of them may work on your system.
    Higher resolutions are only recommended when the lower resolutions
    do not work.  You will NOT receive higher quality graphics, but
    rather a 320x200 image will be stretched up.  The video mode is
    changed when you push ``ACCEPT''.

    If the ``SCANLINES'' option is enabled and you are in a high
    resolution video mode (either 640x400 or 640x480), then the game
    will try to create a ``scanline'' effect for you, where every
    second line is black.  This does not always work (in particular
    windowed modes often do not work).

    If the ``FILTERED'' option is enabled, you will get slightly
    blurred image, which you may or may not like (nice for demos, in
    my opinion).  This requires a fast machine.

    There are three options for music playback.  You can have ``NO
    MUSIC'', which is the classic way to play Red Pixel.  You can also
    put some .MOD, .S3M and .XM files into the `music' directory, and
    select ``PLAY MODULES''.  The game will select songs to play at
    random.  Or, you can put a music CD into your CD drive and select
    ``PLAY CD''.

    The ``RECORD DEMOS'' option is explained in the <ref id="sec-demo" name="demo section">.

    In the bottom left corner there is a button (usually labelled
    ``stats'' or similar).  This is explained in the <ref id="sec-stats" name="next section">.


<sect1> Stats <label id="sec-stats">

  <p> 

    ``Stats'' are various little numbers that change how the game
    works, e.g. how much damage each gun can bring about and how fast
    it reloads, how much health you can have, etc.

    You can select different stats from the Options menu, using the
    button in the bottom left corner.  Once you select a stats file,
    the name of the stats file will be displayed in the lower right
    corner of the main menu.  To play with a network or serial game
    with another player, you must both select the same stats file (or
    you will receive an error message).

    Included with the game are three files `stats', `stats.07' and
    `stats.09'.  `stats' is the more up to date version, providing
    more powerful weapons with quicker reload and respawn rates.
    `stats.07' and `stats.09' provide values from older versions, kept
    only for historic reasons.  You can create your own stats by
    copying one of them, and editing it with a text editor.


<sect1> Demos <label id="sec-demo">

  <p> 

    You can record your deathmatches into demo files.  To do this,
    switch on the ``Record demos'' option in the Options screen.

    When you start a new game, it will automatically save a demo into
    the current directory, named `demoXXXX.rec'.  Under Linux it will
    also try your home directory.

    To play a demo, simply choose the ``Play Demo'' menu item under
    ``Start'', then select a demo recording file.

    Special keys available only in demo playback mode:

    <itemize>
      <item> Enter - switch which player camera focuses on
      <item> S - hold this down for slow motion mode
      <item> F - hold this down for fast forward mode
      <item> P - take screen shot
    </itemize>

    Please note that if you exit a demo before its completion, it will
    display the frag count as of the time you quit.  (Sorry about
    that.)

    If you record a cool demo, whether a demostration of a cool move
    in solo mode, or a nice, bloody deathmatch, please send it to me!

    If a demo does not play back properly, sent it to me for
    debugging.  I won't be able to save the demo, but it may help me
    track down bugs to prevent this sort of thing in the future.  If
    you really hate losing demos, try recording on both machines.
    Chances are, one of the recordings will be correct.


<sect1> Tips

  <p> 

    <itemize>
      <item> Use the 3D sound to find where your opponent is.  Also, eating
             food does not make a noise, but picking up things does.

      <item> After you pick up an item, place a mine there.  Works also for
             regenerating walls (will not flash).
    
      <item> The scanner is good for running away, as well as tracking down.
    
      <item> If are being mowed down with a minigun, run and drop mines!  The
    	     blood will conceal it :)
    
      <item> Jump over your enemy and lay mines.
    
      <item> Jump up ladders, never climb.
    </itemize>



<!-- Next Section: The Map Editor -->

<sect> The Map Editor <label id="sec-mapeditor">


<sect1> Map editor keys

  <p>

    After starting the map editor with `red -e' you will be
    presented with a blank screen.  On the bottom there is a palette
    and on the top there is a description of the current map, showing
    the top-left map coordinates and size.

    <itemize>
      <item> arrow keys to pan around
      <item> 1, 2, 3 to change editing modes (tiles, items, starting locations)
      <item> I, J, K, L to change map size
      <item> Ctrl-N to clear
      <item> Ctrl-S to save
      <item> Ctrl-L to load
      <item> Ctrl-Q to quit (warning: does not prompt!)
    </itemize>

    Select an item or tile with the left mouse button, place it on
    the map with the left mouse button.  Right mouse button clears.

    There is a set maximum of 24 starting locations on a single map.
    These appear as white flags (edit mode 3).


<sect1> Custom maps

  <p>

    If you wish to play your custom maps, make sure that you have
    exactly the same file on both machines!  And make sure you send
    them to me so I can put them up on my web page.

    For compatibility reasons, filenames MUST be all lowercase on
    case-sensitive operating systems (i.e. Linux), and everyone should
    stick to the DOS 8.3 filename limits.



<!-- Next Section: History -->

<sect> Game history

  <p> August 1999:

    I originally thought of the idea for this game about half a year
    before I developed it (Jan 1999).  At the time I was trying to write a
    top-down shooter called `Raid II' (dropped about 5 times!) so I
    delayed it, while my brother worked on the tiny little sprites.

    The development (starting June that year) took three months.
    The basic engine was working in a week, the rest of the time was
    used getting the serial connection to go, and to tweak things a
    little.  It has been a year since.

    Yesterday I fixed some really annoying bugs (see log.txt), and
    tweaked the stats to increase the frag counts.  Now I am writing
    this SGML manual to learn SGML.  It has been a successful project.

    But the code sucks. :-)
    
  <p> June 2000

    The code has been cleaned up a lot, so is better now.  It's
    still not worth a 1.0 though.  :-)

  <p> December 2001

    I've had a change of heart and labelled it 1.0, just to "finish"
    it.


<sect1> Known Bugs

  <p>

    <itemize>
      <item> the blood particles drip through the walls.  This is too cool to fix!
      <item> the guy sometimes gets stuck inside a wall (often after explosion)
      <item> a ladder directly below a tile will allow the guy to pop up into the tile
      <item> you can jump through tiles placed diagonally
    </itemize>
