  2.  The Game

  2.1.

  Concept



  The concept is a platform deathmatch game.  You run around a tile-
  based map, picking up various items and shooting your opponent.
  Original.



  2.2.

  Story


  You have been thrown in a dungeon with a handful of other prisoners.
  Contained within the dungeon are various magical objects, mostly
  weapons, which respawn after a certain time period.

  Surrounded by such weapons of destruction, you cannot resist the
  temptation to kill everyone around you.



  2.3.

  Compiling



  If you are planning to use a precompiled executable, you can skip this
  section.

  Firstly you need a working C compiler.  I use gcc under Linux
  (obviously), djgpp under DOS, and mingw32 under Windows.

  Then you need to install the Allegro game programming library (WIP
  3.9.32 or above).  If you want sockets support, you will also need to
  install Libnet.  If you want CD playing support, you will also need to
  install libcda.  (see below for URLs)

  From there you should be able to simply type `make' in the game's root
  directory.  If you don't have Libnet, type `make WITHOUT_LIBNET=1'.
  If you want CD playing supprt, add `WITH_LIBCDA=1' to the command
  line.  If you are compiling with mingw32, add `MINGW32=1'.

  Under Linux console you will need to run the binary with root
  permissions.  See `readme.lnx' in the Allegro distribution for more
  information.


  2.3.1.

  o  gcc: http://www.gnu.org/

  o  djgpp: http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/

  o  libcda: http://www.psynet.net/tjaden/



  2.4.

  Starting the game


  Simply run the executable to start, optionally passing the following
  command line arguments.  Please note that they are case sensitive.



     -e Start the ``map editor''.


     -l Use bright version of mouse cursor.  Designed to be used on hard
        to see laptop displays.


     -s Use alternative ``stats'' for items.


     -q Skip introduction (quick!).


     -v Display version number.


     -d Enable ``demo'' recording.


     -m Mute sound.


  You can collate the options together, e.g. `red -qld'.






  2.5.

  Connecting via a serial cable


  Link two computers via a serial cable and start the game.  Select
  Start --> Serial, and then the correct COM port.  Enter your name,
  then wait for the computers to connect.

  If an error occurs, check to make sure you used the right command line
  option.  If you're are running a DOS executable under Windows, try
  running under pure DOS.  (If you have a Logitech mouse you could also
  also try what I did, and get updated mouse drivers (MouseWare) for it
  from their web site.)

  From here on, you will be shown a map selection screen.  Only the maps
  existing on both computers will be displayed.  Please make sure the
  maps are identical, otherwise your games will be unsynchronised. Press
  the up and down arrow keys to select a map. When you are ready to
  play, press `F10'.

  If your game become unsynchronised, quit the level and restart.  If it
  ever says ``SYNC PROBLEM'', then you'd better restart from the serial
  connection procedure.

  Note: serial connection is currently not implemented in the native
  Windows port.



  2.6.

  Connecting via Berkeley sockets or Winsock



  Note: you must have compiled with Libnet support for this to work.

  One machine must select `Listen' while the one other selects
  `Connect'.  It works better if the listening machine starts first.
  The connecting machine will need to enter the IP address of the
  listening machine (e.g. 192.168.1.1).  DNS names are not supported.

  After connection, the game acts as it would with a serial connection.

  Note: as this driver simply emulates a perfect serial link via a
  network, you can still only play two player games.  Also, you need a
  fast connection between the machines, since the game still runs
  synchronously.



  2.7.

  Controls



  o  Use the following keys to move around.  They are all equivalent.







            W                 T                  Up
        A - S - D       F - G - H         Left - Down - Right







  o  Aim the gun with the mouse, fire with the left mouse button.


  o  Select the weapon with the number keys, and with Q, E, R, Y.  The
     weapons you have collected will be displayed on the left.


  o  Press Enter or press the right mouse button to lay a mine.


  o  If you have one and you are running under Linux or Windows, you can
     switch weapons using a mouse wheel on an Intellimouse compatible
     mouse.  Please read `readme.lnx' in the Allegro distribution to see
     how to set this up under Linux.  Your mileage may vary, so don't be
     disappointed if it doesn't work.

  o  TAB to see your scores.

  o  ESC to quit.

  o  F12 to see the frame rate counter.



  2.8.

  Items



  o  Weapons

  o  Knife

  o  Pistol

  o  Shotgun

  o  Uzi

  o  M16 (just a big gun, nothing like an M16)

  o  Minigun

  o  Bow with explosive arrows

  o  Bazooka

  o  Mines



  o  Other items:

  o  Chicken (+health)


  o  Coke (+health)

  o  Armour.  Takes half the damage from an attack (1 health = 2 armour)

  o  Goggles.  Lights up your vision, for about a minute.

  o  Backpack.  You drop half of all your ammo when you die, but your
     guns disappear.

  o  Bloodlust.  Double damage for all weapons, except mines.  Be
     careful!

  o  Scanner.  Points in the direction of your enemy.



  2.9.

  Stats



  Included with the game are three files `stats', `stats.07' and
  `stats.09'.  `stats' is the more up to date version, providing more
  powerful weapons with quicker reload and respawn rates.  `stats.07'
  and `stats.09' provide values from older versions, kept only for
  historic reasons.

  You can create your own stats by copying one of them, and editing it
  with a text editor.

  Note that both machines will need exactly the same file, and both must
  run with the `-s' command-line option.  You have been warned.



  2.10.

  Demos



  You can record your deathmatches into demo files.  To do this, first
  start Red Pixel using the `-d' command-line option.

  When you start a new game, it will automatically save a demo into the
  current directory, named `demoXXXX.rec' or, if that is unwritable,
  into your home directory (if you don't know what I'm talking about,
  don't worry).

  To play a demo, simply choose the ``Play Demo'' menu item under
  ``Start''.

  Special keys available only in demo playback mode:


  o  Enter - switch which player camera focuses on

  o  S - hold this down for slow motion mode

  o  F - hold this down for fast forward mode

  o  P - take screen shot

  Please note that if you exit a demo before its completion, it will
  display the frag count as of the time you quit.
  If you record a cool demo, whether a demostration of a cool move in
  solo mode, or a nice, bloody deathmatch, please send it to me!

  If a demo does not play back properly, sent it to me for debugging.  I
  won't be able to save the demo, but it may help me track down bugs to
  prevent this sort of thing in the future.  If you really hate losing
  demos, try recording on both machines.



  2.11.

  Tips




  o  Use the 3D sound to find where your opponent is.  Also, eating food
     does not make a noise, but picking up things does.

  o  After you pick up an item, place a mine there.  Works also for
     regenerating walls (will not flash).


  o  The scanner is good for running away, as well as tracking down.


  o  If are being mowed down with a minigun, run and drop mines!  The
     blood will conceal it :)


  o  Jump over your enemy and lay mines.


  o  Jump up ladders, never climb.





  3.  The Map Editor

  3.1.

  Map editor keys


  After starting the map editor with `red -e' you will be presented with
  a blank screen.  On the bottom there is a palette and on the top there
  is a description of the current map, showing the top-left map
  coordinates and size.


  o  arrow keys to pan around

  o  1, 2, 3 to change editing modes (tiles, items, starting locations)

  o  I, J, K, L to change map size

  o  Ctrl-N to clear

  o  Ctrl-S to save

  o  Ctrl-L to load


  o  Ctrl-Q to quit (warning: does not prompt!)

  Select an item or tile with the left mouse button, place it on the map
  with the left mouse button.  Right mouse button clears.

  There is a set maximum of 24 starting locations on a single map.
  These appear as white flags (edit mode 3).



  3.2.

  Custom maps


  If you wish to play your custom maps, make sure that you have exactly
  the same file on both machines!  And make sure you send them to me so
  I can put them up on my web page.

  For compatibility reasons, filenames MUST be all lowercase on case-
  sensitive operating systems (i.e. Linux), and everyone should stick to
  the DOS 8.3 filename limits.

  Game history

  August 1999:

  I originally thought of the idea for this game about half a year
  before I developed it (Jan 1999).  At the time I was trying to write a
  top-down shooter called `Raid II' (dropped about 5 times!) so I
  delayed it, while my brother worked on the tiny little sprites.

  The development (starting June that year) took three months.  The
  basic engine was working in a week, the rest of the time was used
  getting the serial connection to go, and to tweak things a little.  It
  has been a year since.

  Yesterday I fixed some really annoying bugs (see log.txt), and tweaked
  the stats to increase the frag counts.  Now I am writing this SGML
  manual to learn SGML.  It has been a successful project.

  But the code sucks. :-)


  June 2000

  The code has been cleaned up a lot, so is better now.  It's still not
  worth a 1.0 though.  :-)



  4.1.

  Known Bugs



  o  the blood particles drip through the walls.  This is too cool to
     fix!

  o  the guy sometimes gets stuck inside a wall (often after explosion)

  o  a ladder directly below a tile will allow the guy to pop up into
     the tile

  o  you can jump through tiles placed diagonally



  4.2.

  To do

  Here are some things that I have not bothered to finish.


  o  proper networking (client-server, packet loss detection, etc.)

  o  use a scripting language

  o  3 or more player support

  Most of these probably will not see the light of day unless someone
  else does it.
