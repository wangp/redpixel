Ok, some quick docs:

extern char sk_desc[];
        Who made what.

int     skReady     ();
        Returns number of characters waiting in buffer.

int     skRecv      ();
        Returns a character from the receive buffer.

void    skRead      (unsigned char *, int);
        Reads num characters from receive buffer.

void    skPutback   ();
        Puts last read character back.

void    skClear     ();
        Clears receive buffer.

int     skWaiting   ();
        Returns num chars waiting in the send buffer.

void    skSend      (unsigned char);
        Puts a char into the send buffer.

void    skSendString(unsigned char *);
        Yep, what you're thinking.

void    skWrite     (unsigned char *, int);
        Puts num chars into send buffer.

void    skFlush     ();
        Force all characters in the send buffer to be sent.

void    skHand      (unsigned int);

int     detect_UART (unsigned);

int     skOpen      (int, int, int);
        Open COM port.  e.g.                   
            opened = skOpen(COM1, BAUD_19200, STOP_1 | BITS_8 | PARITY_NONE);

int     skEnableFIFO();
        Enable FIFO buffers if hardware allows.

void    skClose     ();
        Call this at the end of the program, or whenever.
        You MUST call this!


I haven't used SK in a while, so check the source in case I've forgotten.
