--------------
  ù Story ù
--------------

    You have been thrown in a dungeon with a handful of other prisoners.
    Contained within the dungeon are various magical objects, mostly weapons,
    which respawn after a certain time period.

    Surrounded by such weapons of destruction, you cannot resist the
    temptation... yes!


------------------
  ù Controls ù
------------------

    Three easy steps:

    (1) Move your little guy with the keyboard.  There are three layouts:

	    W               T                   Up
	A - S - D       F - G - H       Left -  Down  - Right

    (2) Aim the gun with the mouse.  Left click to shoot. 

    (3) On the left of the screen the weapons you collect will be displayed.

	Right click on one to select it.
	Or use the number keys across the top of the keyboard.
	Press Enter to lay a mine.

    Other stuff:

	TAB to see your scores.
	ESC to quit.

	F12 to see frames per second (FPS).  This is a development thing,
	so it's not supposed to work properly. Just push it real fast and see.


--------------
  ù Items ù
--------------

    Weapons:

	Knife
	Pistol
	Shotgun
	Uzi
	M16 (just a big gun, nothing like an M16)
	Minigun
	Bow with EXPLOSIVE arrows
	Bazooka
	Mines

    Other items:

	Chicken     +50 health (200 max)

	Coke        +15 health

	Armour      +100 armour (300 max)

	Goggles     light up your vision for one minute

	Backpack    you drop half of all your ammo when you die,
		    but your guns disappear

	Bloodlust   double damage of your weapons (except mines) - be careful!
		    lasts 30 seconds


-----------------------------
  ù Command line Options ù
-----------------------------

    Type RED to start.

    To use the map editor, type RED -EDIT.

    To use a different COM port for the serial connection (default is COM2)
    type RED -COMx, where x is the com port number.


--------------------------
  ù Serial Connection ù
--------------------------

    Details:

    Link two computers via serial cable in COM 1-4 (see Command line options).
    Select Start --> Serial.  Enter your name, then wait for the computers to
    connect.  If it hangs, press Ctrl-Alt-End and try again.

    From here on, you will be shown a map selection screen.  Only the maps
    existing on BOTH computers will be displayed.  Please make sure the maps
    are identical, otherwise your games will be unsynchronised.  Press Up/Down
    to selection a map.  You may also have a conversation of here if you wish.
    Please feel free to use any obscene words you desire.

    (Note: The chat box was designed in case the game ever supported Internet
     play.  However it may be also useful in other areas, e.g. library :)

    When you are ready to die, press F10.

    If it ever says SYNC PROBLEM, then you'd better quit and restart.

    Tip: Use the 3D sound to find where your opponent is.  Also, eating food 
    does not make a noise, but picking up things does.


-------------------
  ù Map Editor ù
-------------------

    Keys:

    Arrow keys to scroll around.

    1-3 to select between 1) tiles, 2) items, 3) start locations (24 max)

    Keypad + - / * to change map height, width.

    L,S to Load or Save.

    ESC to quit (does NOT ask to save)

    Choose something from the bottom, then left click to place, right click 
    to delete.

    If you create a good map, please email it to us so we can put it on the
    web site.


---------------------
  ù Completeness ù
---------------------

    Red Pixel is uncompleted. There is still IPX and Internet play to be done.
    It is possible I will do IPX soon, if there is any interest, but Internet
    play is harder (especially to test), so may never see the light of day.
